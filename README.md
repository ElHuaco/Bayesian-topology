# Bayesian-topology
R implementation of the K2 algorithm for learning the topology of Bayesian belief networks.

## TODO:
- Measuring computing time in R:

- Optimize running time with log probabilities
- Randomize order and output relative probabilities of structures found
- Implement with ``bnstruct`` package, plot the graph and test the accuracy as well.
- Test performance of our R implementation VS ``bnstruct``
