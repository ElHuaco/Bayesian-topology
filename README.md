# Bayesian-topology
R implementation of the K2 algorithm for learning the topology of Bayesian nets.

## TODO:
1. Implement the same with ``bnstruct``
2. Compare ``bnstruct`` VS ours relative probabilities found, as well as computation time.
3. Use monte carlo sampling with a known joint distribution of many variables to check that we return the highest relative probability to the correct structure.
